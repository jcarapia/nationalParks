Snow can fall any month of the year, so be prepared for chilly weather even in summer.\n\nFall colors emerge on the alpine tundra in August and in the low valleys in early September.

Travelers along it see the relatively low-elevation taiga forest give way to high alpine tundra and snowy mountains, culminating in North America's tallest peak, 20,310' Denali. Wild animals large and small roam un-fenced lands, living as they have for ages. Solitude, tranquility and wilderness await."
